# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

Cluster analysis is a data analysis technique that attempts to identify meaningful, naturally occurring classes within a dataset and differentiates them as clusters.

The main objective is to discover hidden relationships in data based on specific characteristics. Cluster analysis is used for the implementation of customer segmentation which is a process of organizing customers into specific groups or classes based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. Dividing customers into segments optimizes the significance of each customer to the business. It drives profits by modifying advertisements and campaigns related to the more popular products. Cluster investigation gives bits of knowledge that permit businesses to bore down into the wants and needs of each product, permitting them to offer more personalized items. In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis through cluster analysis via RFM segmentation using Pyspark. We have clustered the customers based on RFM where R stands for recency, F stands for frequency, and M stands for Monetary. Recency shows how recently the customer has made a purchase, Frequency shows how they bought something, and Monetary shows how much they spend on average, The K-Mean clustering technique is used to form clusters.
